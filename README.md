# Abstract: 
Tire Pressure Monitoring System are safety devices installed to warn the user that atleast one or more tires are either under or over inflated. The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act dictates that vehicles in United States must include a tire pressure monitoring system of some kind. There has been a constant surge in accidents due to uncertainity about the tire pressure. Therefore, to  address this problem, we are proposing a simple, economic and practical solution in the form of a mobile application which alerts the user when the pressure goes down the permissible limit. This can be achieved using Sensor Technology and IOT.

The main idea is to monitor the pressure using a sensor, attached to the tire, then push the data to the cloud servers.When the tire pressure is below or above the required limit, push notification will be sent to the user as an alert.

# Competitive Landscape: 
Low presure in tires can be displayed either using indirect TPMS or direct TPMS. Indirect TPMS relies on speed sensors whereas direct TPMS relies on pressure monitoring sensors. There are very few software applications available to analyse low pressure in tires. Most of the available systems are not economical. For example: 
Garmin Tire pressure monitoring sensors are available at $70 per unit. 

# Differentiator: 
Our proposed solution will provide the benefits of both modern hardware and software technologies. Our application will take data from the server and alert the user when the pressure drops below the limit.
